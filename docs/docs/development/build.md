# Building LichtFeld Studio

The standard presets, `build` and `debug`, both build the complete
application feature set, keep tests out of the normal app graph, compile for one
native CUDA architecture, use at most six parallel jobs, and automatically use
`sccache` or `ccache` when either launcher is installed.

```sh
cmake --preset build
cmake --build --preset build
```

`build` is a Release configuration in `build/`. `debug` is the same feature set
compiled with debug information, in `build-debug/`:

```sh
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug
```

Neither preset disables USD, FFmpeg, RmlUi, Python, MCP, or GUI
support. The compiler cache can be disabled without changing the feature set:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF
cmake --build build -j6
```

## Release-only dependency profiles

Native x64 Windows and Linux builds can opt into Release-only vcpkg packages.
Release and RelWithDebInfo use the same dependency recipe, with separate build
and installation directories so switching presets preserves each application's
objects and configuration:

| Platform | Configure and build preset | Application configuration | Build directory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | `windows-release` | Release | `build-windows-release/` |
| Windows x64 | `windows-relwithdebinfo` | RelWithDebInfo | `build-windows-relwithdebinfo/` |
| Linux x64 | `linux-release` | Release | `build-linux-release/` |
| Linux x64 | `linux-relwithdebinfo` | RelWithDebInfo | `build-linux-relwithdebinfo/` |

CMake only lists the profiles for the current host OS. These profiles require
the same compiler, CUDA toolkit and system dependencies as the standard build;
they do not install or change the development environment.

On Windows, from the existing x64 MSVC/CUDA development shell:

```sh
cmake --preset windows-release
cmake --build --preset windows-release
cmake --preset windows-relwithdebinfo
cmake --build --preset windows-relwithdebinfo
```

On Linux:

```sh
cmake --preset linux-release
cmake --build --preset linux-release
cmake --preset linux-relwithdebinfo
cmake --build --preset linux-relwithdebinfo
```

The profiles select `cmake/triplets/release-only/` as a vcpkg triplet overlay.
It retains the standard `x64-windows` / `x64-linux` names and linkage policies,
and sets `VCPKG_BUILD_TYPE` to `release` inside the triplet. Both target and
host tools use that recipe; host tools do not introduce another Debug package
graph. The installed vcpkg checkout and its built-in triplets are not edited.

All application features remain enabled, with tests off and the same compiler
cache and parallelism settings as `build`. RelWithDebInfo retains the normal
developer defaults, including Vulkan validation and shader debug information.
Consequently, its first configure may install additional validation packages.
RelWithDebInfo adds symbols to the application; it does not automatically add
symbols to every vcpkg dependency. Windows vcpkg Release builds normally request
debug information, while Linux dependency symbols depend on the port and its
compiler flags. These profiles do not change those flags or disable optimization.

### Reusing packages when switching configurations

Each build directory keeps its own `vcpkg_installed/`. Share the **vcpkg binary
archive cache**, not an installation directory. The presets preserve the normal
vcpkg cache configuration, including user-provided `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` and
`VCPKG_DEFAULT_BINARY_CACHE`; no private feed is required. On a cache miss,
vcpkg builds the missing package through the normal manifest/registry path.

The first Release-only install may need to compile packages even if the standard
dual-configuration packages are already cached: the overlay has a different ABI
hash, and vcpkg cannot extract just the Release half as a new cached package.
Once stored, compatible packages can be restored into the other profile's
installation directory. Returning to either existing build directory reuses its
installed packages and incremental build outputs.

This requires unchanged compiler/toolchain, port versions, features and overlay
contents, and a binary cache that allows reading and writing. A changed package
or dependency ABI can require a rebuild. Windows and Linux packages are distinct;
they do not share compiled binaries. An `already installed` or `Restored ...`
message is reuse, not source compilation. Application CMake regeneration may
still take time even when vcpkg installs nothing.

### Keeping an existing Ninja build directory

To migrate an existing native Windows x64 Ninja Release tree in `build/` and
keep the usual application/test build command, configure it once with:

```sh
cmake --preset windows-release -B build -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release --target LichtFeld-Studio lichtfeld_tests -j 4
```

On Linux x64, use `linux-release` in the configure command. `-B build` overrides
the preset's default directory; without it the configure and build commands
would address different trees. For single-config Ninja, `--config Release` is
optional: the configuration comes from `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` at configure time.

The migration lets vcpkg reconcile installed packages with the Release-only
recipe and may rebuild dependencies once. Keep this directory on that profile
afterward, and keep Debug in a separate tree. There is no need to delete the
existing build cache. In particular, OpenMesh can populate
`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` even for Ninja; the profile guard checks the actual
generator rather than treating that cache entry as evidence of a multi-config
build.

### Debug and standard fallback

Use `cmake --preset debug` and `cmake --build --preset debug` for Debug. The
standard `build` and `debug` profiles and their existing directories are
unchanged. vcpkg's standard triplets provide both dependency configurations;
Debug-only ports are not generally supported.

The Release-only overlay is rejected before vcpkg installation if it is used
with Debug, an unknown build configuration, a multi-config generator, or
nonmatching target and host triplets. Use a separate standard build directory
for multi-config generators, other architectures or custom triplets. Apart
from a deliberate migration as described above, do not alternate standard and
Release-only profile policies inside one directory.

The guard can be checked without configuring or compiling the application:

```sh
cmake --list-presets=all
cmake -P tests/cmake/test_vcpkg_profiles.cmake
```

With `BUILD_TESTS=ON`, these checks are also registered as
`lichtfeld.cmake.vcpkg_profiles` and run with `ctest --test-dir build -L fast`.
They do not need application binaries or a vcpkg installation.

For build validation, build and launch both profiles on the target OS, then
switch back without deleting either directory. Check the vcpkg install log for
reuse; exercise Python imports and Vulkan validation in the RelWithDebInfo
application. The script checks above do not replace compiler or runtime tests.

## Reproducible build measurements

For compiler or dependency work, disable compiler caching so clean and
incremental timings describe work performed by the compiler rather than cache
hits:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-measure -DENABLE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
/usr/bin/time -v cmake --build build-measure -j6
```

Delete the build directory before measuring clean configure time. Keep
`BUILD_TESTS=OFF`: tests are a separate opt-in graph and are not representative
of the application build.

## Compiler cache behavior

`ENABLE_COMPILER_CACHE` defaults to `ON`. CMake prefers `sccache`, falls back to
`ccache`, and continues without a launcher when neither is installed.

Single-config GNU and Clang Release builds also default
`COMPILER_CACHE_PATH_INDEPENDENT` to `ON`. CMake compiles C and C++ through a
build-local source alias, makes build-tree paths relative, and applies
`-ffile-prefix-map` so identical commits can share objects across Git
worktrees. Consequently, `__FILE__` is repository-relative (for example,
`./src/core/scene.cpp`) and remains useful in logs and assertions. Disable this
behavior independently when exact checkout paths are required:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCOMPILER_CACHE_PATH_INDEPENDENT=OFF
```

Debug, RelWithDebInfo, multi-config, MSVC, and Windows builds retain their
original source paths. This keeps debugger source lookup unchanged; a build
that deliberately enables relative debug paths would need the debugger's
source-map equivalent.

On non-Windows CUDA builds the existing launcher still covers CUDA. sccache's
nvcc decomposition canonicalizes the input source, however, so CUDA does not
have the same cross-worktree guarantee as C and C++. On Windows CUDA remains
uncached because the supported nvcc/launcher combinations are less reliable
there. The current tree does not use project precompiled headers. If PCH is
reintroduced, validate cache hits for PCH consumers explicitly; in particular,
prefer include-style PCH entries over absolute header paths, because CMake
otherwise embeds the checkout path in its generated PCH wrapper. MSVC PCH
consumers also have substantial sccache limitations.

Inspect the active cache with `sccache --show-stats` or `ccache --show-stats`.
Disable the launcher for compiler diagnostics, cold-build comparisons, or when
investigating a cache-specific failure. Size the cache for the complete active
working set: sccache's default 10 GiB cache can evict entries during a large
multi-worktree build. Set `SCCACHE_CACHE_SIZE` before starting the server, or
configure the equivalent disk-cache size in sccache's configuration file.

## Parallelism and vcpkg

Use no more than six build jobs on a 31 GiB development machine:

```sh
cmake --build build -j6
```

vcpkg runs during configure rather than during the Ninja build. Its automatic
package-build concurrency is capped at six. Override it explicitly only on a
machine with enough memory:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DLFS_VCPKG_MAX_CONCURRENCY=4
```

An explicit `VCPKG_MAX_CONCURRENCY` environment value remains supported for
standard vcpkg workflows. The project does not set global `MAKEFLAGS`; the
chosen build tool remains responsible for job control.

## Shared dependency downloads

Immutable uv release archives are cached outside disposable
build trees. The default is `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/lichtfeld/downloads` or
`~/.cache/lichtfeld/downloads` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%/LichtFeldStudio/downloads`
on Windows, and `~/Library/Caches/LichtFeldStudio/downloads` on macOS. Override
it with `-DLFS_DOWNLOAD_CACHE_DIR=PATH` when a CI worker provides its own cache.

Supported archives are verified against their declared SHA-256 before reuse.
Concurrent worktrees share a lock and publish completed downloads atomically,
so a killed or parallel configure cannot expose a partial archive.

## CUDA architecture policy

With CUDA 12.x, local builds retain nvcc's `-arch=native` mode and compile one
architecture (for example `sm_89` on an RTX 4090). A controlled 66-object A/B
was faster with native than with a resolved `89-real`, and `cuobjdump` verified
that the native build contained the intended SASS without a release fan-out.
CUDA 13.1 and newer retain the existing numeric compatibility path. Portable
PTX and release packaging continue to use their explicit architecture policies.

The configure summary prints the selected architecture. Confirm it before a
timed build:

```text
CUDA: native (native)
```

## Tests

Tests remain opt-in, keeping test-only package restore and target generation
out of the normal application loop without changing any shipped feature. The
canonical [source build guide](../../building_and_distribution.md#tests)
documents the test build targets, CTest tiers, and required real-data layout.

`BUILD_VISUALIZER_TESTS` defaults to `OFF`. When enabled, its visualizer test
executable is included in the default full build, so the usual app build also
compiles the enabled regression tests. Normal app and packaging builds with this
option disabled do not build that executable.

Before a complete MSVC build, use the
[Windows build preflight](windows-build-preflight) to check Windows-specific
source contracts and replay affected configured C/C++ translation units without
code generation or linking.
